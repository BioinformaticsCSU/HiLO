HiLO algorithm could conduct drug-disease predictions on two datasets: Fdataset_ms and Cdataset_ms, which can be loaded by matlab.

(1) Fdataset_ms
Wrname: the DrugBank IDs of drugs;

Wdname: the OMIM IDs of diseases;

drug_AtcS: drug's ATC code similarity matrix;

drug_TargetS: drug's target profile similarity matrix;

disease_PhS: disease phenotype similarity matrix;

disease_DoS: disease ontology similarity matrix;

didr: disease-drug association matrix.

(2) Cdataset_ms
Wrname: the DrugBank IDs of drugs;

Wdname: the OMIM IDs of diseases;

drug_AtcS: drug's ATC code similarity matrix;

drug_TargetS: drug's target profile similarity matrix;

disease_PhS: disease phenotype similarity matrix;

disease_DoS: disease ontology similarity matrix;

didr: disease-drug association matrix.


We collected drug_AtcS, drug_TargetS, and disease_DoS for Fdataset_ms and Cdataset_ms.
